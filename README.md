# MannWhitney_pairwisecomparisons_Holmcorrected_EffectSize
This script computes two indices of effect size for pairwise comparisons based on the Mann Whitney U statistic.
The two indices are the Probability of Superioriy (PS) and the r based on the standardization of the U statistic (r = z / sqrt(n)).
Detailed references can be found in the book: Effect Sizes for Research by Grissom and  Kim.
